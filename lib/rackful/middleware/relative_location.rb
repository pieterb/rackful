=begin markdown
Rack middleware, inspired by {Rack::RelativeRedirect}.

This middleware allows you to return a relative or absolute path your +Location:+
response header.
This was common practice in HTTP/1.0, but HTTP/1.1 requires a full URI in the
+Location:+ header.
This middleware automatically translates your path to a full URI.

Differences with {Rack::RelativeRedirect}:

-   uses Rack::Request::base_url for creating absolute URIs.
-   the `Location:` header, if present, is always rectified, independent of the
    HTTP status code.
